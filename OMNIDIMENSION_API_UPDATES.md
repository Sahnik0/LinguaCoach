# Omnidimension API Integration Updates

## Recent Updates

Based on analysis of a working implementation, we've made the following improvements to our Omnidimension API integration:

1. **Added Accept Headers**: Added `'Accept': 'application/json'` headers to all API requests to ensure the server returns JSON responses.

2. **Updated API Endpoint Paths**: Changed endpoints to use the correct paths:
   - Changed from `/calls/{id}` to `/calls/logs/{id}` for call status and analysis

3. **Improved Response Handling**: Enhanced handling of API responses to accommodate different response formats:
   - Added handling for `response.json || response` structure
   - Added support for various transcript field names: `transcript`, `call_transcript`, `full_transcript` 
   - Added support for additional ID fields: `requestId`, `call_log_id`, `id`

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved the proxy route to better handle various response types (HTML, JSON, etc.)

## Known API Structure

The Omnidimension API follows this general structure:

- **Agent Management**:
  - `POST /agents/create` (or `/agents`) - Create an agent
  - `GET /agents` - List agents

- **Call Management**:
  - `POST /calls/dispatch` - Initiate a phone call
  - `GET /calls/logs/{id}` - Get call status and logs

## Response Formats

Responses may come in different formats:

1. Direct response:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "12345",
     "status": "initiated"
   }
   ```

2. Wrapped response:
   ```json
   {
     "json": {
       "id": "12345",
       "status": "initiated"
     }
   }
   ```

## Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are properly set:
- `OMNIDIM_API_KEY` - Your Omnidimension API key
- `OMNIDIM_BASE_URL` - Base API URL (default: "https://backend.omnidim.io/api/v1")

## Common Issues and Solutions

### CORS Issues
- The proxy implementation at `/app/api/proxy/omnidimension/route.ts` handles CORS issues by proxying requests through your Next.js server.

### Response Format Issues
- Our code now handles multiple response formats and field names to be more resilient.

### Network Issues
- Added better error handling for network connectivity issues.

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring API responses to identify any other response formats or endpoint changes.
- Consider implementing the detailed analysis methods from the reference implementation if needed.
