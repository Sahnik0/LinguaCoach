# AI Conversation Analysis in Demo Mode

The Language Coach App now uses AI-powered conversation analysis in demo mode, providing authentic feedback rather than pre-defined responses.

## AI Analysis Features

### Real-Time Analysis of Your Conversation

Instead of generic pre-defined feedback, the demo mode now performs AI analysis on your actual conversation transcript. This provides:

1. **Personalized Feedback**: Analysis is based on your specific conversation patterns
2. **Contextual Suggestions**: Recommendations reflect the actual content discussed
3. **Accurate Scoring**: Metrics are calculated from your speech patterns and content
4. **Language-Specific Analysis**: Adapts to the language of your practice session

### Analysis Components

The AI analysis generates:

- **Score Metrics**: Numerical scores (0-100) for fluency, grammar, vocabulary, etc.
- **Strengths**: Your strong areas identified from the conversation
- **Weaknesses**: Areas that need improvement based on actual usage
- **Suggestions**: Specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
- **Detailed Feedback**: Comprehensive analysis of your conversation
- **Improvement Areas**: Core skills to focus on for next sessions
- **Next Steps**: Concrete actions to improve your language skills

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service Options

The system attempts to use one of two AI services for analysis:

1. **Primary**: [Groq API](https://groq.com) for fast, accurate analysis
2. **Fallback**: Local AI option (if configured) using compatible endpoints like Ollama or LM Studio

### How It Works

1. **Transcript Collection**: The demo voice interface builds a transcript as you speak
2. **Analysis Request**: When the call ends, the transcript is sent for AI analysis
3. **Processing**: The AI evaluates your language use across multiple dimensions
4. **Result Integration**: Analysis is incorporated into your session results

## Optimizing Voice Recognition

For the best voice transcription experience:

1. **Speak Clearly**: Moderate your pace and articulate clearly
2. **Environmental Factors**: Reduce background noise and echo if possible
3. **Microphone Position**: Position your microphone close to your mouth
4. **Browser Support**: Chrome and Edge provide the best speech recognition
5. **Pause Briefly**: Small pauses between sentences help with recognition
6. **Check Transcript**: Monitor the transcript to ensure your speech is being captured correctly

The system includes enhanced speech recognition with:
- Continuous recognition to avoid gaps in transcription
- Interim results for responsive feedback
- Confidence thresholds to filter out uncertain transcriptions
- Duplicate prevention to avoid repeated text

## API Integrations

### Groq API

The system first attempts to use the Groq API for analysis. This requires:
- An API key in the `.env.local` file as `GROQ_API_KEY`
- A valid transcript from your conversation session

### Local AI Option

If Groq is unavailable, the system can use a local AI endpoint:
- Configure via `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AI_ENDPOINT` in `.env.local`
- Compatible with OpenAI-format API endpoints (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- Example config: `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_AI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`

## Fallback Mechanism

If both AI services are unavailable, the system provides intelligent fallback analysis:
- Difficulty-appropriate scoring based on your selected level
- General feedback suitable for your practice scenario
- Relevant suggestions for language improvement

## Benefits Over Previous System

1. **Authenticity**: Feedback reflects your actual speaking patterns and content
2. **Relevance**: Suggestions are contextual to your specific conversation
3. **Improvement Tracking**: More accurate benchmarking of your progress
4. **Learning Value**: More meaningful insights to guide your practice

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with AI analysis:

1. **Check Transcript**: Ensure your voice is being transcribed correctly
2. **API Configuration**: Verify API keys are set correctly in `.env.local`
3. **Network Issues**: Check internet connectivity for API-based analysis
4. **Local AI**: If using local AI, ensure the service is running and accessible
5. **Browser Issues**: Try a different browser if recognition is poor (Chrome works best)
6. **Microphone Access**: Ensure you've granted microphone permissions
7. **Speaking Style**: Try speaking more slowly and clearly if transcription is inaccurate
